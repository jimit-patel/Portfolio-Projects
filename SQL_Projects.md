# SQL Portfolio Projects

[ScienceQtech Employee Project:](https://github.com/jimit-patel/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/ScieanceQtech_Employee.sql)

Description: The project involves working with a database containing information about employees and projects at ScienceQtech, a startup in the data science field. The task involves creating a database, importing data, creating an ER diagram, and writing SQL queries to extract specific information from the database. 

The SQL queries involve selecting and filtering specific columns, grouping data by department or role, finding the maximum and minimum salaries, assigning ranks based on experience, creating views and stored procedures, calculating bonuses, and calculating average salary distribution by continent and country. Additionally, a stored function is used to check whether the job profile assigned to each employee in the data science team matches the organizationâ€™s set standard. 

Overall, the task involves using SQL to analyze employee data, extract specific information, and optimize performance through indexing.


[AirCargo Database Management Project:](https://github.com/jimit-patel/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/AirCargo.sql)

Description: This project involves working with the Air Cargo Airlines database and performing various SQL operations to analyze the data. The aim of the project is to identify regular customers, analyze the busiest routes, and determine ticket sales details to improve the airline's operability and become more customer-centric.

The project involves creating an ER diagram for the database, creating tables, implementing constraints, and performing queries to extract data. Various SQL operations   such as Joins, Group By, Having, and window functions have been used to extract meaningful insights from the data.

Additionally, the project involves creating views and stored procedures to simplify the data extraction process and improve the efficiency of queries. The stored         procedures perform various operations such as grouping the distance travelled by each flight into three categories and extracting details of all passengers flying       between a range of routes defined in runtime.

Overall, this project provided hands-on experience in managing a complex database for an aviation company, and demonstrated the importance of efficient data management   in improving customer service and increasing operational efficiency. The project also showcases various SQL operations and best practices, which can be used in other     projects and real-world scenarios.
