[AirCargo Database Management Project](https://github.com/jimit-patel/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/AirCargo.sql)

  Description: This project involves working with the Air Cargo Airlines database and performing various SQL operations to analyze the data. The aim of the project is to identify regular customers, analyze the busiest routes, and determine ticket sales details to improve the airline's operability and become more customer-centric.

  The project involves creating an ER diagram for the database, creating tables, implementing constraints, and performing queries to extract data. Various SQL operations such as Joins, Group By, Having, and window functions have been used to extract meaningful insights from the data.

  Additionally, the project involves creating views and stored procedures to simplify the data extraction process and improve the efficiency of queries. The stored procedures perform various operations such as grouping the distance travelled by each flight into three categories and extracting details of all passengers flying between a range of routes defined in runtime.

  Overall, this project provided hands-on experience in managing a complex database for an aviation company, and demonstrated the importance of efficient data management in improving customer service and increasing operational efficiency. The project also showcases various SQL operations and best practices, which can be used in other projects and real-world scenarios.
